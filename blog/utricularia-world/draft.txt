The World of Utricularia

Join me as I explore the interesting world of the genus Utricularia.

	For as long as I can remember, plants have been an area of interest to me. Recently, I have acquired a hobby of collecting specifically carnivorous plants, which I find particularly interesting. One genus that really embedded itself into my life was, as you probably guessed by this post's title, the genus Utricularia, commonly called bladderworts or utrics (informally).
	I will begin by explaining how this plant is carnivorous. Underneath the substrate, along the plant's roots, are hundreds of tiny traps--"bladders"--that can catch tiny arthropods.

	At the opening of the trap, there are these trigger hairs which, when touched, cause the trap to open itself rapidly like a bellows sucking air into itself; this action then (hopefully) causes the critter that triggered the trap to get sucked into the trap along with the water. The trap then proceeds to digest its prey while pumping out water that got sucked in, getting it ready for the next prey.

	This ability to catch and digest prey allows this plant to attain the necessary nutrients for growth. The reason for this carnivorous nature is that, in the wild, these plants usually live in places with a general lack of nutrients in the substrate, which would cause most plants to grow poorly.
